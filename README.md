Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

- I have implemented the 3 required pages (index, bio, resume) correctly, but not the projects page since that was an add on! The HTML and CSS validation sites do not present any errors on those 3 required pages.

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

- I have collaborated with TA Matt Manfre and consulted the internet for help on dealing with image features and navigation bar.
